Coffee Machine Python Project â˜•
Description
This project simulates a coffee vending machine using Python. It allows users to order coffee, handles payments via note denominations, checks resources availability, and prepares the chosen drink dynamically. It's a great example of combining real-world scenarios with programming concepts.

Features
Three coffee options: Latte, Espresso, and Cappuccino.

Resource availability check to ensure enough ingredients for the selected coffee.

Payment handling using R10, R20, and R50 notes.

Change calculation and display.

Ability to view a resources report.

Option to turn off the machine or make multiple orders.

How to Run
Clone this repository using:

bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd coffee-machine-python
Run the coffee_machine.py script in a Python environment:

bash
python coffee_machine.py
Usage
Start the program and follow the prompts to select a coffee type (latte, espresso, or cappuccino).

Enter how many R10, R20, and R50 notes you are inserting when prompted.

If payment is successful and there are sufficient resources, your coffee will be prepared!

Type report to see current resources or off to turn off the machine.

Planned Improvements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.

Introduce additional coffee options and customizations (e.g., sugar levels).

Enhance error handling for invalid inputs.

Technologies Used
Python (Command-line application)
